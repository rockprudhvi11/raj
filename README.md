Abstraction basically is the art of hiding implementation details from user and provide the user what they want. Letâ€™s try to understand with real world example. Most of us are quite fond of owning a car. When we go to place order for the car we are really not interested to understand very fine details of implementation of each and every component insider the car engine, Gear box etc., we leave those technical details and implementation for manufacturing engineers and mechanics to understand we are simply interested in the car so does the manufacturing company. They are interested to exactly provide us what we want and hide the fine implementation details from us. Likewise, there are tons of real-world examples where abstraction is in play whether smartphone you are using or smart television you are watching all have implemented abstraction in one way or the other.
